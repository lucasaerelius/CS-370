# CS370

CS-370 was a course that focused on exploring advanced topics in computer science, with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence and intelligent systems. The files attached to this repository demonstrate my practical application of key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks to address a real-world problem.

In my role as an AI developer for a gaming company, I was assigned the task of developing a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the pirate agent. Within the code, specifically in the qtrain() function, I created the necessary logic to enable the pirate agent to effectively navigate the maze while maximizing the rewards obtained.

When considering the broader field of computer science, it becomes evident that computer scientists are professionals who engage in research, experimentation, and the application of their knowledge to solve various problems. Their contributions are crucial as they play a significant role in facilitating technological advancements that we benefit from today.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first gathering comprehensive information about the subject matter. I prefer to adopt a pragmatic approach, breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components.

In terms of ethical responsibilities to both end users and the organization, I believe it is imperative to adhere to certain principles. Firstly, I prioritize safeguarding any entrusted information by implementing robust security measures within my code. Additionally, I strive to develop products that do not cause harm, utilizing my knowledge and skills responsibly. I actively question the data and challenge any hidden biases that might be present, promoting fairness and inclusivity. Ultimately, I aim to create products that can reach the widest possible audience, ensuring inclusiveness is a fundamental aspect of their design.
